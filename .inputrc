#CATION: IF vi-ins/cmd-mode-string WITH CURSORS ESCAPE SEQUENCES DOESN'T WORK DON'T TRY TO FIND THE SOLTUION FOR IT I TIRED AND I FOUND OUT THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO THE SYNTAX WAS CORRECT STILL GETIING STARNGE BEHAVIOUR BETWEEN SAME TWO FILES I HAD.SOMETIMES IT WORKS SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T ESPECIALLY IF FOLLWOING IS ADDED IT'S NOT GONNA WORK EVEN AFTER YOU REMOVE IT.

# but still to allow 8-bit values, thus allowing input of the UTF-8
# characters. Again, 8-bit output needs to be turned on, so that when
# programs output UTF-8 sequences, they don't get converted down to
# escaped 7-bit sequences, which would confuse XTerm into thinking they
# are control sequences.
